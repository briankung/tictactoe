**Bugs**

* [FIXED] Win check fails for rows 2 and 3
* [FIXED] Win check fails for columns B and C
* [FIXED] Computer cheats like a whore in certain situations.
* [FIXED] Also, you know...doesn't win. Legally.
* Computer chooses spots randomly when not in immediate danger
* Falls prey to traps
* User can overwrite old inputs and rewrite the board <.<

Oddly enough, random is almost good enough to pass as AI.

Added some bitching and moaning. Look for "pick up from here" or "pick up" to pick up on code.
